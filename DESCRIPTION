Description: As a successor of the packages BatchJobs and BatchExperiments,
    batchtools provides a parallel implementation of Map for high performance
    computing systems managed by schedulers like SLURM, Torque, or SGE.
    Moreover, the package provides an abstraction mechanism to define
    large-scale computer experiments in a well-organized and reproducible way.
